Description
==============
This application is a web application made for students to easily keep track of their grades through an academic term. It will provide the user with clear information so they can see where they are excelling and otherwise where more time should be dedicated to. Our web based application is aimed towards providing the user with information in a clear and concise manner. This way the user may combat negative results in their own way. We are striving for a simplistic and well designed application so it is easy to navigate. The app allows the user to log in/log out and navigate the application through it's side menu.
